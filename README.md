# To-Do-Lists
Project 1


OK, this app adds to do lists to a list of to-do lists with a button
clicking on a new list will bring you to a second screen in which 
you can add items/descriptions to a to-do list.

there's also a checkbox nect to each item so you can mark the item completed.

I intend on adding remove functinoality so you can remove the to-do lists,
and remove items in individual to-do lists.

I also want to add the code so it remembers if an item was checked as completed.

as far as its current functionality goes, I don't see any obvious bugs.
